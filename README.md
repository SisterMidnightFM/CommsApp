# Image Overlay Web App

This is a simple web-based tool that allows users to upload an image, overlay a PNG graphic (such as a watermark or logo), and add custom text in a predefined font.

## Features

- Upload a background image
- Automatically overlay a PNG image
- Add and position editable text
- Download the final composed image

## How to Use

1. Open `App V9.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Save a template image in the same folder as template.png. Make sure it is 1080x1350px.
3. You can change the font by saving a font in the same folder as font.otf
4. The PNG overlay will be added automatically.
5. Enter your custom text and adjust its position.
6. Click "Download" to save the final image. This may not work in your browser. You can instead right click on the image and click save.

## Requirements

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No server setup needed â€“ fully client-side

## Notes

- The overlay PNG (`overlay.png`) must be present in the same folder as the HTML file.
